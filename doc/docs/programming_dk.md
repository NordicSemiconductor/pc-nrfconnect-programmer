# Programming devices

In the {{app_name}}, you can program [supported devices](index.md#supported-hardware) or a custom board with a supported chip that allows for communication with J-Link, Nordic Secure DFU devices, and MCUboot devices.

!!! tip "Tip"
      If you experience any problems during the programming process, press Ctrl-R (command-R on macOS) to restart the {{app_name}}, and try programming again.

## Device-specific procedures

The following devices have specific programming requirements or procedures:

| Device                            | Description                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nRF9160 DK            | To program the nRF9160 DK, see [Updating the nRF9160 DK firmware using Programmer](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/device_guides/working_with_nrf/nrf91/nrf9160.html#updating_the_dk_firmware_using_programmer). |
| Nordic Thingy:91 X     | To program Nordic Thingy:91 X, see [Programming Nordic Thingy prototyping platforms](programming_thingy.md).
| Nordic Thingy:91      | To program Nordic Thingy:91, see [Programming Nordic Thingy prototyping platforms](programming_thingy.md).
| Nordic Thingy:53      | To program Nordic Thingy:53, see [Programming Nordic Thingy prototyping platforms](programming_thingy.md). |
| Nordic Thingy:52      | Nordic Thingy:52 can be programmed using the [general programming procedure](#general-programming-procedure), but only through J-Link and a 10-pin programming cable. |
| nRF52840 Dongle       | To program the nRF52840 Dongle, see [Programming the nRF52840 Dongle](programming_nrf52840_dongle.md). |
| Custom board          | When programming a custom board with a supported chip, use the [general programming procedure](#general-programming-procedure), but make sure that the J-Link version is compatible with the relevant Arm® CPU. For example, an nRF52 Series DK cannot be used to program a Nordic Thingy:91 since the J-Link on an nRF52 Series DK does not support the programming of the Arm Cortex®-M33 CPU of Nordic Thingy:91. |

## General programming procedure

!!! note "Note"

      Do not unplug or turn off the device during programming.

To program a supported development kit, complete the following procedure:

1. Open nRF Connect for Desktop and launch the {{app_name}}.
2. Connect a development kit to the computer with a USB cable and turn it on.
3. Click **Select device** and choose the device from the drop-down list.</br>
   The button text changes to the name and serial number of the selected device, and the **Device Memory Layout** section indicates that the device is connected.
4. If you have not selected the **Auto read memory** option under the **Device** menu and wish to visually see the memory layout before you program, click **Read** in the menu. If you have selected it, the memory layout will update automatically.
5. Drag and drop the HEX file into the **File Memory Layout** section. Alternatively, click **Add file** to add the files you want to program, using one of the following options:

    - Select the files you used recently.
    - If there are no recently used files, click **Browse** from the drop-down list.

6. Select the firmware image file from the file browser that opens up; either a HEX file (in most cases) or a ZIP (when programming cellular modem firmware or multi-image programming with MCUboot).
7. Depending on the device type and the programming method, use one of the following programming options in the **Device** panel:

    - **Erase & write** for J-Link
    - **Write** for MCUboot, Nordic Secure DFU, or modem firmware

   When programming starts, a progress bar appears.
