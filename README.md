The Programmer app is a cross-platform tool that enables programming firmware to
Nordic Semiconductor devices and custom devices that use Nordic Semiconductor
hardware.

The application supports J-Link, Nordic Secure DFU, and MCUboot programming
methods, using both HEX and ZIP files. It lets you inspect the memory layout of
the firmware files and the devices.
